1. However, realizing high-delity nonreciprocity in low-loss integrated photonic systems **remains challenging**.

## 被难住，遇到难处
1. However, some precipitation of insoluble surface species obviously occurs in pristine solutions, which **impedes** Mg deposition but does not fully avoid it.
2. Catalysts located on the left side of the volcano in Figure 1 bind oxygen too strongly, and thus the reaction is **retarded** by desorption of the OHads.
3. These studies have shown that the discovery of cathode materials is mainly **inhibited** by the nature of Mg2+ ions:
4. However, despite these advantages, the development of rechargeable MIBs remains **hindered** by a lack of suitable cathode materials and electrolytes and overall anode-electrolyte-cathode incompatibilities.
